    <string name="churchHistory">
        The Basel Missionaries arrived the coast of Cameroon on Dec 23rd 1886
        with faith and zeal to plant God’s word in the Cameroonian soil.
        The first three who arrived were: Rev Gottlieb Munz, Rev Christian Dilger,
        Rev Johannes Bizer and Rev Friederich Becher. Rev Becker unfortunately died
        of malaria four days after their arrival. Writing back home about this,
        Rev Christian Dilger had this to say “It is the Lord whom it has
        pleased to introduce our band in such a way.
        We therefore can and will not withdraw.” And they did not withdraw.

        \n\n
        <i>
        From then on, through rough terrain, under difficult weather, threatened
        by the deadly malaria fever, they strode over long distances, taking
        the gospel of the resurrected Jesus Christ to Cameroonians. Their zeal
        was daunted only by the First World War when Germany finally succumbed
        to the military pressure of Britain and France and the territory was partitioned.
        Britain was in control of 1/5 of the colonial territory and France had 4/5.
        This had serious consequences on the missionary enterprise. The missionaries,
        especially Germans, were forced to leave Cameroon since it was feared that the
        Germans could use their nationals to achieve their wish of reclaiming Cameroon
        (the last white missionaries to leave were the Australian R. Rhode, and the
        American Bender) and missionary work of the Basel Mission was left in the
        hands of the indigenes, championed by Johannes Litumbe Ekesse who directed the
        affairs of the Basel mission with some native teachers/catechists. Basel
        Missionary stations in the French Cameroon were left for some time unattended,
        until 1917 when the French-Paris Mission came in on the invitation of the Basel Mission.
        </i>
        \n\n

        After the world war, the Basel missionaries did not return to Cameroon until
        1923 when the Home Board applied for the return of their missionaries.
        The Home Board of the mission was permitted to send back to Cameroon only
        three Swiss missionaries to serve under the French-Paris mission. In 1925,
        full permission was granted for the return of Basel missionaries.
        By December of that year Rev. Vielhauer returned to Bali. Others
        followed him shortly after.

        \n\n

        By the early thirties the Basel mission had opened many new schools,
        medical institutions and theological colleges. In 1939, the works of
        the various missionary bodies in Cameroon were once more nearly grounded
        as a result of the Second World War. White missionaries had to leave the
        country. The works in the mission stations were carried out mostly by the
        native Pastors, Catechists and Teachers. After the war, many white Basel
        missionaries did not come back to Cameroon. This created the problem of
        personnel for the work in the field. In order to combat the problem the
        Home Board of the mission recommended the ordination and training of indigenous
        teachers/catechists to take up the mission work in the country.

        \n\n

        As time went on, the Basel Mission thought the Church they had founded in
        Cameroon needed to be independent. For this to happen the Church had to be
        self-propagating (can evangelise on its own), self-governing (can govern itself),
        and self-supporting (can finance its own activities). By 1957, both the Basel
        mission and the indigenes thought the time was ripe for independence.
        Consequently, on the 13th of November 1957, at 11am, the Presbyterian
        Church in Cameroon was born when the final draft of the constitution was
        unanimously adopted at Ntanfoang-Bali.
        This was followed by prayer, hymns of praise and the ringing of the Ntanfoang Church bell.

        \n\n

        From then on the Presbyterian Church has grown in leaps and bounds
        and now exists in all of the ten regions of Cameroon.

    GOD moves in a mysterious way,\n
    His wonders to perform ;\n
    He plants His footsteps in the sea,\n
    And rides upon the storm.\n\n
    2 Deep in unfathomable mines\n
    Of never-failing skill\n
    He treasures up His bright designs,\n
    And works His sovereign will.\n\n
    3 Ye fearful saints, fresh courage\n
    take;\n
    The clouds ye so much dread\n
    Are big with mercy, and shall break\n
    In blessings on your head.\n\n
    4 Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,\n
    But trust Him for His grace ;\n
    Behind a frowning providence\n
    He hides a smiling face.\n\n
    5 His purposes will ripen fast,\n
    Unfolding every hour;\n
    The bud may have a bitter taste,\n
    But sweet will be the flower.\n
    6 Blind unbelief is sure to err,\n
    And scan His work in vain ;\n
    God is His own interpreter,\n
    And He will make it plain.\n\n\n

    WHEN all Thy mercies, O my
    God!
    My rising soul surveys,
    Transported with the view, I’m
    lost
    In wonder, love, and praise.\n\n
    2 O how shall words, with equal
    warmth,
    The gratitude declare
    That glows within my ravished
    heart!
    But Thou canst read it there.\n\n
    3 Unnumbered comforts to my soul
    Thy tender care bestowed,
    Before my infant heart conceived
    From whom these comforts
    flowed.\n\n
    4 When in the slippery paths of
    youth,
    With heedless steps I ran,
    Thine arm, unseen, conveyed me
    safe,
    And led me up to man.\n\n
    5 When worn with sickness, oft hast
    Thou
    With health renewed my face;
    And, when in sins and sorrows
    sunk,
    Revived my soul with grace.\n\n
    6 Ten thousand thousand precious
    gifts
    My daily thanks employ;
    Nor is the least a cheerful heart
    That tastes those gifts with joy.\n\n
    7 Through every period of my life
    Thy goodness I’ll pursue;
    And after death, in distant worlds,
    The glorious theme renew.\n\n

    O JESUS, ever present,

    Thy very Name is music

    To muse on things above;
    It drew our harder manhood
    With cords of mighty love.\n\n
    2 How oft to sure destruction
    Our feet had gone astray,
    Hadst Thou not, patient Shepherd,
    Been Guardian of our way.
    How oft, in darkness fallen,
    And wounded sore by sin,
    Thy hand has gently raised us,
    And healing balm poured in.\n\n
    3 O Shepherd good! we follow
    Wherever Thou wilt lead:
    No matter where the pasture,

    To Thine eternal fold.\n\n

    Praises unto God most high
    He unites us one by one

    For our state and for the sick
    And the troubled everywhere

    That the holy one gives us
    With all saints gone before us
    In their footsteps we will walk.\n\n

    In the race for faithful ones
    Girded by faith, peace and love
    Running to Christ in glory.\n\n

    5 Drop Thy still dews of quietness,

    And let our ordered lives confess
    The beauty of Thy peace.\n\n

    CHRISTIANS, awake, salute the
    happy morn,
    Whereon the Saviour of the world
    was bom;
    Rise to adore the mystery of love,
    Which hosts of angels chanted
    from above;
    With them the joyful tidings first
    begun
    Of God Incarnate and the
    Virgin’s Son:\n\n
    2 Then to the watchful shepherds it
    was told,
    Who heard the angelic herald’s
    voice, ‘Behold,
    I bring good tidings of a Saviour’s
    birth
    To you and all the nations upon
    earth;
    This day hath God fulfilled His
    promised word,
    This day is bom a Saviour, Christ
    the Lord.’\n\n
    3 He spake; and straightway the
    celestial choir,
    In hymns of joy unknown be-
    fore, conspire.
    The praises of redeeming love they
    sang,
    And heaven’s whole orb with
    hallelujahs rang:
    God’s highest glory was their
    anthem still,
    Peace upon earth, and mutual
    good-will.\n\n
    4 To Bethlehem straight the enlightened
        shepherds ran,
    To see the wonder God had
    wrought for man,
    And found, with Joseph and the
    blessèd Maid,
    Her Son, the Saviour, in a man-
    ger laid ;
    Amazed, the wondrous story they
    proclaim,
    The first apostles of His infant
    fame.\n\n
    5 Like Mary, let us ponder in our mind
    God’s wondrous love in saving
    lost mankind;
    Trace we the Babe, who has re-
    trieved our loss,
    From His poor manger to His
    bitter Cross;
    Treading His steps, assisted by
    His grace,
    Till man’s first heavenly state
    again takes place.\n\n
    6 Then may we hope, the angelic
    thrones among,
    To sing, redeemed, a glad tri-
    umphal song.
    He that was born upon this joyful
    day
    Around us all His glory shall
    display;
    Saved by His love, incessant we
    shall sing
    Of angels and of angel men the
    King.\n\n

    And so it continued both day
    and night.\n\n
    3 And by the light of that same star,
    Three wise men came from

    To seek for a King was their
    intent,

    it went.\n\n
    4 This star drew nigh to the north-
    west,
    O’er Bethlehem it took its rest,
    And there it did both stop and stay
    Right over the place where Jesus
    lay.\n\n
    5 Then entered in those wise men
    three,
    Full reverently upon their knee,
    And offered there in His presence
    Their gold and myrrh and
    frankincense.\n\n

    ONCE in royal David’s city
    Stood a lowly cattle-shed,
    Where a mother laid her Baby
    In a manger for His bed.
    Mary was that mother mild,
    Jesus Christ her little Child.\n\n
    2 He came down to earth from heaven
    Who is God and Lord of all,\n
    And His shelter was a stable,
    And His cradle was a stall.
    With the poor and mean and lowly
    Lived on earth our Saviour holy.\n\n
    3 And through all His wondrous
    child-hood
    He would honour and obey,
    Love, and watch the lowly maiden
    In whose gentle arms He Lay.
    Christian Children all must be
    Mild, obedient, good as He.\n\n
    4 For He is our childhood’s pattern;
    Day by day like us He grew;
    He was little, weak, and helpless
    Tears and smiles like us He
    knew;
    And He feeleth for our sadness,
    And He shareth in our gladness.\n\n
    5 And our eyes at last shall see Him,
    Through His own redeeming
    love;
    For that Child so dear and gentle
    Is our Lord in heaven above;
    And He leads His children on
    To the place where He is gone.\n\n
    6 Not in that poor lowly stable,
    With the oxen standing by,
    We shall see Him, but in heaven,
    Set at God’s right hand on high,
    When, like stars, His children
    crowned
    All in white shall wait around.\n\n

    O LITTLE town of Bethlehem,
    How still we see thee lie!
    Above thy deep and dreamless
    sleep
    The silent stars go by:
    Yet in thy dark streets shineth
    The everlasting Light;
    The hopes and fears of all the
    years
    Are met in thee to-night.\n\n
    2 For Christ is born of Mary;
    And, gathered all above,
    While mortals sleep, the angels
    keep
    Their watch of wondering love.
    O morning stars, together
    Proclaim the holy birth,
    And praises sing to God the King,
    And peace to men on earth.\n\n
    3 How silently, how silently,
    The wondrous gift is given!
    So God imparts to human hearts
    The blessings of His heaven.
    No ear may hear His coming;
    But in this world of sin,
    Where meek souls will receive
    Him, still
    The dear Christ enters in.\n\n
    4 O Holy Child of Bethlehem,
    Descend to us, we pray;
    Cast out our sin, and enter in;

    The great glad tidings tell;\n
    O come to us, abide with us,
    Our Lord Immanuel.\n\n

    IT came upon the midnight clear,
    That glorious song of old,
    From angels bending near the earth
    To touch their harps of gold:-
    “Peace on the earth, good will to
    men,
    From heaven’s all-gracious King!”
    The world in solemn stillness lay
    To hear the angels sing.\n\n
    2 Still through the cloven skies they
    come
    With peaceful wings unfurled;
    And still their heavenly music floats
    O’er all the weary world;
    Above its sad and lowly plains
    They bend on hovering wing,
    And ever o’er its Babel sounds
    The blessèd angels sing.\n\n
    3 But with the woes of sin and strife
    The world has suffered long
    Beneath the angel strain have rolled\n
    Two thousand years of wrong;
    And man, at war with man, hears not
    The love song which they bring;
    O hush the noise, ye men of strife,
    And hear the angels sing.\n\n
    4 And ye, beneath life’s crushing load
    Whose forms are bending low,
    Who toil along the climbing way
    With painful steps and slow,
    Look now! For glad and golden hours
    Come swiftly on the wing;
    O rest beside the weary road,
    And hear the angels sing.\n\n
    5 For, lo! The days are hastening on,
    By prophet bards foretold,
    When with the ever-circling years
    Comes round the Age of Gold,
    When peace shall over all the earth
    Its ancient splendours fling,
    And the whole world give back the
    song.

    WHEN the Lord of Love was
    here,
    Happy hearts to Him were dear,
    Though His heart was sad ;
    Worn and lonely for our sake,
    Yet He turned aside to make
    All the weary glad.\n\n
    2 Meek and lowly were His ways;
    From His loving grew His praise,
    From His giving, prayer:
    All the outcasts thronged to hear;
    All the sorrowful drew, near
    To enjoy His care.\n\n
    3 When He walked the fields, He drew
    From the flowers, and birds,
    and dew,
    Parables of God;
    For within His heart of love
    All the soul of man did move,
    God had His abode.\n\n
    4 Lord, be ours Thy power to keep,
    In the very heart of grief,
    And in trial, love ;
    In our meekness to be wise,
    And through sorrow to arise
    To our God above.\n\n
    5 Fill us with Thy deep desire
    All the sinful to inspire
    With the Father’s life;
    Free us from the cares that press
    On the heart of worldliness,
    From the fret and strife.\n\n
    6 And, when in the fields and woods
    We are filled with Nature’s moods,
    May the grace be given
    With Thy faithful heart to say,
    ‘All I see and feel to-day
    Is my Father’s heaven.’\n\n

    WHERE high the heavenly temple
    stands,
    The house of God not made with
    hands,
    A great High Priest our nature
    wears,
    The Guardian of mankind appears.\n\n
    2 He who for men their surety stood,
    And poured on earth His pre-
    cious blood,
    Pursues in heaven His mighty plan,
    The Saviour and the Friend of
    man.\n\n
    3 Though now ascended up on high,
    He bends on earth a brother’s
    eye;
    Partaker of the human name,
    He knows the frailty of our frame.\n\n
    4 Our fellow-sufferer yet retains
    A fellow-feeling of our pains;
    And still remembers in the skies
    His tears, His agonies, and cries.\n\n
    5 In every pang that rends the heart
    The man of Sorrows had a part;
    He sympathizes with our grief,
    And to the sufferer sends relief.\n\n
    6 With boldness, therefore, at the
    throne,
    Let us make all our sorrows
    known;
    And ask the aids of heavenly power
    To help us in the evil hour.\n\n

    O’er darkness and the grave.
    To Thee they went - the blind,

    The palsied, and the lame,
    The leper with his tainted life,
    The sick with fevered frame;\n\n
    2 And, lo! Thy touch brought life
    and health,
    Gave speech, and strength, and
    sight;
    And youth renewed and frenzy
    calmed\n
    Owned Thee, the Lord of light.
    And now, 0 Lord, be near to bless,

    In crowded street, by restless couch,
    As by Gennesaret’s shore.\n\n

    What grace, O Lord, and beauty
    shone
    Around Thy steps below !
    What patient love was seen in all
    Thy life and death of woe!\n\n
    2. For ever on Thy burdened heart
    A weight of sorrow hung,
    Yet no ungentle, murmuring word
    Escaped Thy silent tongue.\n\n
    3. Thy foes might hate, despise, revile,
    Thy friends unfaithful prove :
    Unwearied in forgiveness still,
    Thy heart could only love.\n\n
    4. O give us hearts to love like Thee,
    Like Thee, O Lord, to grieve
    Far more for others’ sins than all
    The wrongs that we receive.\n\n
    5. One with Thyself, may every eye
    In us, Thy brethren, see
    That gentleness and grace that
    spring
    From union, Lord, with Thee.\n\n

    IMMORTAL Love, for ever full,
    For ever flowing free,
    For ever shared, for ever whole,
    A never-ebbing sea!\n\n
    2 Blow, winds of God, awake and
    blow
    The mists of earth away:
    Shine out, O Light Divine, and show
    How wide and far we stray.\n\n
    3 We may not climb the heavenly
    steeps,
    To bring the Lord Christ down;
    In vain we search the lowest deeps,
    For Him no depths can drown.\n\n
    4 And not for signs in heaven above,
    Or earth below, they look
    Who know with John His smile of
    love,
    With Peter His rebuke.\n\n
    5 In joy of inward peace, or sense
    Of sorrow over sin,
    He is His own best evidence;
    His witness is within.\n\n
    6 And, warm, sweet, tender, even yet
    A present help is He;
    And faith has still its Olivet,
    And love its Galilee.\n\n
    7 The healing of His seamless dress
    Is by our beds of pain;
    We touch Him in life’s throng and
    press,
    And we are whole again.\n\n

    BEHOLD a little Child,
    Laid in a manger bed;
    The wintry blasts blow wild
    Around His infant head.
    But who is this, so lowly laid?
    ’Tis He by whom the worlds
    were made.\n\n
    2 Alas! In what poor state
    The Son of God is seen;
    Why doth the Lord so great
    Choose out a home so mean?
    That we may learn from pride to flee,
    And follow His humility.\n\n
    3 Where Joseph plies his trade,
    Lo, Jesus labours too;
    The hands that all things made
    An earthly craft pursue,
    That weary men in Him may rest,
    And faithful toil through Him
    be blest.\n\n

    The Boy so full of grace;

    May sit and learn at Jesus’ feet.\n\n

    Our boyhood guard and guide;

    That Thy dear love, so great and

    May draw us evermore to Thee.\n\n

        The hands are stretched in
        weakness, not in power.\n\n

        dying Saviour saith,
        ‘Thou too shalt rest in Paradise

        of faith!
        O words of hope for those who
        live to pray!\n\n
        4 Lord, when with dying lips my
        prayer is said,
        Grant that in faith Thy Kingdom I
        may see
        And, thinking on Thy Cross and
        bleeding head,
        May breathe my parting words,
        ‘Remember me.’\n\n
        5 Remember me, but not my shame
        or sin;
        Thy cleansing blood hath washed\n
        73
        His Suffering and Death\n
        them all away;
        Thy precious death for me did
        pardon win;
        Thy blood redeemed me in that
        awful day.\n\n
        6 Remember me; and, ere I pass away,
        Speak Thou the assuring word
        that sets us free,
        And make Thy promise to my
        heart, ‘Today
        Thou too shalt rest in Paradise
        with Me’\n\n

        WE sing the praise of Him who

        Of Him who died upon the Cross;

        For this we count the world but loss.\n\n

        In shining letters, ‘God is love’;
        He bears our sins upon the Tree;
        He brings us mercy from above.\n\n
        3 The Cross! it takes our guilt away;
        It holds the fainting spirit up;
        It cheers with hope the gloomy day,
        And sweetens every bitter cup;\n\n
        4 It makes the coward spirit brave,
        And nerves the feeble arm for

        IT is a thing most wonderful,
        Almost too wonderful to be,
        That God’s own Son should
        come from heaven,
        And die to save a child like me.\n\n
        2 And yet I know that it is true:
        He chose a poor and humble lot,
        And wept, and toiled, and
        mourned, and died.
        For love of those who loved
        Him not.\n\n
        3 It is most wonderful to know
        His love for me so free and sure;
        But ’tis more wonderful to see
        My love for Him so faint and
        poor.\n\n

        Freshens now the face once faded,
        Peace with God now makes us
        glad.\n\n

        AT the Cross, her station keeping,
        Stood the mournful mother
        weeping,
        Where He hung, the dying Lord;
        For her soul, of joy bereavèd,
        Bowed with anguish, deeply
        grievèd,
        Felt the sharp and piercing sword.\n\n
        2 O, how sad and sore distressèd
        Now was she, that mother
        blessèd
        Of the sole-begotten One;
        Deep the woe of her affliction,
        When she saw the crucifixion
        Of her ever-glorious Son.\n\n
        3 Who, on Christ’s dear mother gazing
        Pierced by anguish so amazing,
        Born of woman, would not weep?
        Who, on Christ’s dear mother
        thinking,
        Such a cup of sorrow drinking,
        Would not share her sorrows
        deep?\n\n
        4 For His people’s sins chastisèd,
        She beheld her Son despisèd,
        Scourged, and crowned with thorns
        entwined;
        Saw Him then from judgment
        taken,
        And in death by all forsaken,
        Till His spirit He resigned.\n\n
        5 Jesus, may her deep devotion
        Stir in me the same emotion,
        Fount of love, Redeemer kind,
        That my heart, fresh ardour
        gaining,
        And a purer love attaining,
        May with Thee acceptance find.\n\n

    JESUS our Saviour, has been raised
    from death,
    So shall they follow, all who sleep
    in death;
    Through Adam all men die,
    though life be brief
    Through Jesus Christ we shall be
    brought to life\n\n
    2 When Jesus cometh, to rule o’er
    the world,
    He’ll conquer powers, of this sin-
    ful world;
    And death, the last of foes, God
    shall defeat,
    For “God put all things under
    Jesus’ feet.”\n\n
    3 Death now is conquered, victory is
    complete.
    Death, where’s your victory?
    Where’s your power to hurt?
    Death gets its power from sin;
    Sin’s power from law;
    God gives us victory through
    Christ our Lord.\n\n

    HAIL to the Lord’s Anointed,
    Great David’s greater Son!
    Hail, in the time appointed,
    His reign on earth begun!
    He comes to break oppression,
    To let the captive free,
    To take away transgression,
    And rule in equity.\n\n
    2 He comes with succour speedy
    To those who suffer wrong,
    To help the poor and needy,
    And bid the weak be strong,
    To give them songs for sighing,
    Their darkness turn to light
    Whose souls, condemned and
    dying,
    Were precious in His sight.\n\n
    3 He shall come down like showers
    Upon the fruitful earth,
    And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
    Spring in His path to birth.
    Before Him, on the mountains,
    Shall peace, the herald, go;
    And righteousness in fountains
    From hill to valley flow.\n\n
    4 For Him shall prayer unceasing
    And daily vows ascend,
    His Kingdom still increasing,
    A Kingdom without end.
    The mountain dews shall nourish
    A seed, in weakness sown,
    Whose fruit shall spread and
    flourish
    And shake like Lebanon.\n\n
    5 O’er every foe victorious,
    He on His throne shall rest,
    From age to age more glorious,
    All blessing and all-blest.
    The tide of time shall never
    His covenant remove;
    His Name shall stand for ever;
    That Name to us is Love.\n\n

    COME down, O Love Divine,
    Seek Thou this soul of mine,
    And visit it with Thine own ardour
    glowing;
    O Comforter, draw near,
    Within my heart appear,
    And kindle it, Thy holy flame be-

    2 O let it freely burn,
    Till earthly passions turn
    To dust and ashes, in its heat con-

    And let Thy glorious light
    Shine ever on my sight,
    And clothe me round, the while
    my path illuming.\n\n
    3 Let holy charity
    Mine outward vesture be,
    And lowliness become mine inner

    Which takes the humbler part,
    And o’er its own shortcomings
    weeps with loathing.\n\n

    With which the soul will long,
    Shall far outpass the power of

    Wherein the Holy Spirit makes His

    Hasting from afar,
    Ever journeying onward,
    Guided by a star.\n\n
    2 There their Lord and Saviour
    Meek and lowly lay,
    Wondrous Light that led them
    Onward on their way,
    Ever now to lighten
    Nations from afar,
    As they journey homeward
    By that guiding star.\n\n
    3 Thou who in a manger
    Once hast lowly lain,
    Who dost now in glory.
    O’er all kingdoms reign,
    Gather in the heathen,
    Who in lands afar
    Ne’er have seen the brightness
    Of Thy guiding star.\n\n
    4 Gather in the outcasts,
    All who’ve gone astray,
    Throw Thy radiance o’er them,
    Guide them on their way;
    Those who never knew Thee,
    Those who’ve wandered far,
    Guide them by the brightness
    Of Thy guiding star.\n\n
    5 Onward through the darkness
    Of the lonely night,
    Shining still before them
    With Thy kindly light,
    Guide them, Jew and Gentile,
    Homeward from afar,
    Young and old together,
    By Thy guiding star\n\n

    HUSHED was the evening hymn,
    The temple courts were dark,
    The lamp was burning dim
    Before the sacred ark,
    When suddenly a voice Divine
    Rang through the silence of the
    shrine\n\n
    2 The old man, meek and mild,
    The priest of Israel, slept;
    His watch the temple child,
    The little Levite, kept;
    And what from Eli’s sense was sealed
    The Lord to Hannah’s son
    revealed.\n\n
    3 O give me Samuel’s ear,
    The open ear, O Lord,
    Alive and quick to hear
    Each whisper of Thy word,—
    Like him to answer at Thy call,
    And to obey Thee first of all.\n\n
    4 O give me Samuel’s heart,
    A lowly heart, that waits
    Where in Thy house Thou art, \n
    Or watches at Thy gates
    By day and night, —a heart that still
    Moves at the breathing of Thy
    will.\n\n
    5 O give me Samuel’s mind,
    A sweet unmurmuring faith,
    Obedient and resigned
    To Thee in life and death,
    That I may read, with childlike eyes,
    Truths that are hidden from the
    wise.\n\n

    FATHER, in high heaven dwelling,
    May our evening song be telling
    Of Thy mercy large and free;
    Through the day Thy love has
    fed us,
    Through the day Thy care has led us,
    With divinest charity.\n\n
    2 This day’s sins O pardon, Saviour,
    Evil thoughts, perverse behaviour,
    Envy, pride, and vanity;
    From the world, the flesh, deliver,
    Save us now, and save us ever,
    O Thou Lamb of Calvary.\n\n
    3 From enticements of the devil,
    From the might of spirits evil,
    Be our shield and panoply;
    Let Thy power this night de-
    fend us,
    And a heavenly peace attend us,
    And angelic company.\n\n
    4 While the night-dews are distilling,
    Holy Ghost, each heart be filling
    With Thine own serenity.
    Softly let our eyes be closing,
    Loving souls on Thee reposing,
    Ever-blessèd Trinity,\n\n

    I triumph still if Thou abide with me.\n\n

    closing eyes,
    Shine through the gloom, and

    In life and death, O Lord, abide
    with me.\n\n

    3 Not a burden we bear,
    Not a sorrow we share,
    But our toil He doth richly repay;
    Not a grief nor a loss,
    Not a frown nor a cross,
    But is blest if we trust and obey.\n\n
    4 But we never can prove
    The delights of His love,
    Until all on the altar we lay;
    For the favour He shows
    And the joy He bestows,
    Are for them who will trust and
    obey.\n\n
    5 Then in fellowship sweet
    We will sit at His feet,
    Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
    What He says we will do.
    Where He sends we will go,
    Never fear, only trust and obey.\n\n

    Bread of heaven
    Feed me till my want is o’er.\n\n
    2 Open now the crystal fountain,

    Let the fire and cloudy pillar
    Lead me all my journey through:
    Strong Deliverer,
    Be Thou still my strength and shield.\n\n

    GREAT God! And wilt Thou
    condescend
    To be my Father and my Friend?
    I a poor child, and Thou so high,
    The Lord of earth and air and sky.\n\n
    2 Art Thou my Father? Canst Thou
    bear
    To hear my poor imperfect prayer?
    Or wilt Thou listen to the praise
    That such a little one can raise?\n\n
    3 Art Thou my Father, let me be
    A meek obedient child to Thee,
    And try, in word and deed and
    thought,
    To serve and please Thee as I
    ought.\n\n
    4 Art Thou my Father? I’ll depend
    Upon the care of such a Friend,
    And only wish to do and be

    When all my days on earth are past,
    Send down and take me in Thy love
    To be Thy better child above.\n\n

    FATHER, I know that all my life
    Is portioned out for me;
    And the changes that are sure to
    come
    I do not fear to see
    But I ask Thee for a present mind,
    Intent on pleasing Thee.\n\n
    2 I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,
    Through constant watching wise
    To meet the glad with joyful smiles,
    And to wipe the weeping eyes,
    And a heart at leisure from itself,
    To soothe and sympathise.\n\n
    3 I would not have the restless will
    That hurries to and fro,
    Seeking for some great thing to do,
    Or secret thing to know;
    I would be treated as a child
    And guided where I go.\n\n
    4 Whenever in the world I am,
    In whatsoe’er estate,
    I have a fellowship with hearts
    To keep and cultivate,
    And a work of lowly love to do,
    For the Lord on whom I wait.\n\n
    5 So I ask Thee for the daily strength
    To none that ask denied,
    And a mind to blend with outward
    life
    While keeping at Thy side,
    Content to fill a little space,
    If Thou be glorified.\n\n

    Leave to thy God to order and

    From His own fulness, all He takes
    away.\n\n
    4 Be still, my soul: the hour is has-
    tening on
    When we shall be forever with the
    Lord,
    When disappointment, grief, and
    fear are gone,
    Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys
    restored.

    All safe and blessèd we shall meet

    WHO is on the Lord’s side?

    Other lives to bring?
    Who will leave the world’s side?
    Who will face the foe?

    Thou hast made us willing,

    We are on the Lord’s side;

    3 Fierce may be the conflict,

    From victory to victory
    His army He shall lead,

    Ye that are men, now serve Him
    Against unnumbered foes;
    Your courage rise with danger,
    And strength to strength oppose.\n\n

    Stand in His strength alone;
    The arm of flesh will fail you;

    Where duty calls, or danger,
    Be never wanting there.\n\n

    3 Take up thy cross, nor heed the

    And let thy foolish pride be still:
    Thy Lord refused not e’en to die
    Upon a Cross, on Calvary’s hill.\n\n

    3 Cast care aside;
    And on thy Guide
    Lean, and His mercy will provide,–
    Lean, and the trusting soul shall

    Show me what I ought to do.\n\n

    A SAFE stronghold our God is
    still,
    A trusty shield and weapon;
    He’ll help us clear from all the ill
    That hath us now o’ertaken.
    The ancient prince of hell
    Hath risen with purpose fell;
    Strong mail of craft and power
    He weareth in this hour;
    On earth is not his fellow.\n\n
    2 With force of arms we nothing can,
    Full soon were we down-ridden;
    But for us fights the proper Man,
    Whom God Himself hath
    bidden
    Ask ye who is this same?
    Christ Jesus is His Name,
    The Lord Sabaoth’s Son;
    He, and no other one,
    Shall conquer in the battle.\n\n
    3 And were this world all devils o’er,
    and watching to devour us,
    We lay it not to heart so sore;
    Not they can overpower us.
    And let the prince of ill
    Look grim as e’er he will,
    He harms us not a whit;
    For why his doom is writ;
    A word shall quickly slay him.
    4 God’s word, for all their craft and
    force,
    One moment will not linger,
    But, spite of hell, shall have its
    course;
    ’Tis written by His finger.
    And, though they take our life,
    Goods, honour, children, wife,
    Yet is their profit small;
    These things shall vanish all:
    The city of God remaineth.\n\n

    THIS stone to Thee in faith we lay;

    Thine eye be open, night and day,
    To guard this house and sanctuary.\n\n
    2 Here, when Thy people seek Thy

    And dying sinners pray to live,

    4 ‘Hosanna!’ To their heavenly King

    Here to abide, no transient guest?
    Here will the world’s Redeemer reign,

    2 Within these walls let holy peace,

    May burdened hearts find sweet
    release,
    And souls with richest grace be
    crowned.\n\n
    3 May here be heard the suppliant’s
    sigh,
    The weary enter into rest;
    Here may the contrite to Thee cry
    And waiting souls be richly
    blessed.\n\n
    4 Here, when the gospel sound is
    heard,
    And here proclaimed the saving
    name,
    May hearts be quickened, moved,
    and stirred,
    And souls be kindled into flame.\n\n
    5 Here may the dead be made to live,
    The dumb to sing, the deaf to hear;
    And do Thou to the humble give
    Pardon and peace instead of fear.\n\n
    6 Make this, O Lord, Thine own
    abode;
    Thy presence in these courts be
    given;

    Supplies

    Attend with constant care,
    Still walking in your Captain’s sight,

    HARK the voice of Jesus crying—
    “who will go and work to-day?
    Fields are white and harvest
    waiting:
    Who will bear the sheaves
    away?”
    Loud and strong the Master
    calleth,
    Rich reward He offers thee:
    Who will answer, gladly saying?-
    “Here am I; send me, send me!”\n\n
    2 If you cannot cross the ocean,
    And the heathen lands explore,
    You can find the heathen nearer,
    You can help them at your door.
    If you cannot give your thousands,
    You can give the widow’s mite;
    And the least you do for Jesus
    Will be precious in His sight.\n\n
    3 If you cannot speak like angels,
    If you cannot preach like Paul,
    You can tell the love of Jesus,
    You can say He died for all.
    If you cannot rouse the wicked
    With the Judgment’s dread alarms,
    You can lead the little children
    To the Saviour’s waiting arms.\n\n
    4 If you cannot be the watchman,
    Standing high on Zion’s wall,
    Pointing out the path to heaven,
    Offering life and peace to all;
    With your prayers and with your
    bounties
    You can do what Heaven demands;
    You can be like faithful Aaron,
    Holding up the prophet’s hands.\n\n
    5 If among the older people
    You may not be apt to teach:
    “Feed My lambs,” said Christ our
    Shepherd,
    “Place the food within their
    reach.”
    And it may be that the children
    You have led with trembling
    hand
    Will be found among your jewels,
    When you reach the better land.\n\n
    6 Let none hear you idly saying,
    “There is nothing I can do,”
    While the souls of men are dying,
    And the Master calls for you.
    Take the task He gives you gladly
    Let His work your pleasure be;
    Answer quickly when He calleth:
    “Here am I; send me, send me!”\n\n

    Hear thy guardian angel say,
    ‘Thou art in the midst of foes:
    Watch and pray’.\n\n
    2 Principalities and powers,
    Mustering their unseen array,
    Wait for thy unguarded hours:

    Wear it ever, night and day;
    Ambushed lies the evil one:
    Watch and pray.\n\n
    4 Hear the victors who o’ercame;
    Still they mark each warrior’s
    way;
    All with one sweet voice exclaim,
    ‘Watch and pray’\n\n
    5 Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
    Him thou lovest to obey;
    Hide within thy heart His word,

    Hung the issue of the day:

    That only Thou canst cast them
    out;\n\n
    5 And some have found the world
    is vain,
    Yet from the world they break
    not free;
    And some have friends who give
    them pain,
    Yet have not sought a friend in
    Thee;\n\n
    6 And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,
    For none are wholly free from
    sin ;
    And they who fain would serve
    Thee best
    Are conscious most of wrong
    within.\n\n
    7 O Saviour Christ, Thou too art
    Man;
    Thou hast been troubled, tempt-
    ed, tried;
    Thy kind but searching glance can
    scan
    The very wounds that shame
    would hide;\n\n
    8 Thy touch has still its ancient
    power;
    No word from Thee can fruit-
    less fall:
    Hear in this solemn evening hour,
    And in Thy mercy heal us all.\n\n

    2 Look, Father, look on His anoint-

    And only look on us as found
    in Him;
    Look not on our misusing of Thy
    grace,
    Our prayer so languid, and our

    For lo! between our sins and their

    We set the passion of Thy Son

    Deliver us from every touch of ill:

    And all my weariness upon Thee lean.\n\n

    SOWING the seed by the dawn-

    Sowing the seed by the noonday

    Sowing the seed in the fertile soil:
    Oh, what shall the harvest be?\n\n
    3 Sowing the seed of a lingering
    pain:
    Sowing the seed of a maddened
    brain;
    Sowing the seed of a tarnished
    name,\n
    Sowing the seed of eternal shame:
    Oh, what shall the harvest be?\n\n
    4 Sowing the seed with an aching
    heart,
    Sowing the seed while the tear-
    drops start;
    Sowing in hope till the reapers
    come,
    Gladly to gather the harvest home:
    Oh, what shall the harvest be?\n\n

    NOW sing we a song for the
    harvest:
    Thanksgiving and honour and
    praise
    For all that the bountiful Giver
    Hath given to gladden our days.\n\n
    2 For grasses of upland and lowland,
    For fruits of the garden and field,
    For gold which the mine and the
    furrow
    To delver and husbandman yield;\n\n
    3 And thanks for the harvest of beauty,
    For that which the hands can-
    not hold,
    The harvest eyes only can gather,
    And only our hearts can enfold.\n\n
    4 We reap it on mountain and moor-
    land;
    We glean it from meadow and lea;
    We garner it in from the cloudland;
    We bind it in sheaves from the sea.\n\n
    5 But the song it goes deeper and
    higher;
    There are harvests that eye can-
    not see;
    They ripen on mountains of duty,
    Are reaped by the brave and the
    free.\n\n
    6 And these have been gathered and
    garnered,
    Some golden with honour and
    gain,
    And some as with heart’s blood
    are ruddy,\n\n
    The harvests of sorrow and pain.
    7 O Thou who art Lord of the harvest,
    The Giver who gladdens our days,
    Our hearts are for ever repeating
    Thanksgiving and honour and
    praise.\n\n

    LORD of the harvest, once again
    We thank Thee for the ripened
    grain:
    For crops safe carried, sent to cheer
    Thy servants through another year:
    For all sweet holy thoughts, supplied
    By seed-time, and by harvest-tide.\n\n
    2 The bare dead grain, in autumn sown,
    Its robe of vernal green puts on;
    Glad from its wintry grave it springs,
    Fresh garnished by the King of
    kings:
    So, Lord, to those who sleep in Thee
    Shall new and glorious bodies be.\n\n
    3 Daily, O Lord, our prayers be said,
    As Thou has taught, for daily
    bread;
    But not alone our bodies feed,–
    Supply our fainting spirits’ need.
    O Bread of life, from day to day
    Be thou their comfort, food and
    stay!\n\n

    How rich Thy bounties are!
    The rolling seasons, as they move,
    Proclaim Thy constant care.\n\n
    2 When in the bosom of the earth
    The sower hid the grain,
    Thy goodness marked its secret
    birth,
    And sent the early rain.\n\n
    3 The spring’s sweet influence was
    Thine;
    The plants in beauty grew;
    Thou gav’st refulgent suns to shine,
    And mild refreshing dew.\n\n

    Matured the swelling grain;
    A yellow harvest crowns Thy love,

    COME, ye thankful people, come,

    Lord of harvest, grant that we
    Wholesome grain and pure may

    3 Thou dwellest in unshadowed light,
    All sin and shame above–
    That Thou shouldst bear our sin
    and shame,
    How can I tell such love?\n\n
    4 Ah, did not He the heavenly throne
    A little thing esteem,
    And not unworthy for my sake
    A mortal body deem?\n\n
    5 When in His flesh they drove the
    nails
    Did He not all endure?
    What name is there to fit a life
    So patient and so pure?\n\n
    6 So, Love itself in human form,
    For love of me He came;
    I cannot look upon His face
    For shame, for bitter shame.\n\n
    7 If there is aught of worth in me,
    It comes from Thee alone;
    Then keep me safe, for so O Lord,
    Thou keepest but Thine own.\n\n

    SWEET hour of prayer! sweet
    hour of prayer!
    That calls me from a world of care,
    And bids me at my Father’s
    throne
    Make all my wants and wishes known.
    In seasons of distress and grief,
    My soul has often found relief,
    And oft escaped the tempter’s

    Engage the waiting soul to bless;
    And since He bids me seek His
    face,
    Believe His word, and trust His
    grace,
    I’ll cast on Him my every care,
    And wait for thee, sweet hour

    May I thy consolation share,
    Till, from Mount Pisgah’s lofty Height,

    This robe of flesh I’ll drop, and rise
    To seize the everlasting prize;
    And shout, while passing through
    the air,
    “Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of
    prayer!”\n\n

    THE Church’s one foundation
    Is Jesus Christ her Lord :
    She is His new creation
    By water and the word ;
    From heaven He came and sought her
    To be His holy bride;
    With His own blood He bought her,
    And for her life He died.\n\n
    2 Elect from every nation,
    Yet one o’er all the earth,
    Her charter of salvation
    One Lord, one faith, one birth:
    One holy Name she blesses,
    Partakes one holy food,
    And to one hope she presses,
    With every grace endued.\n\n
    3 Though with a scornful wonder
    Men see her sore oppressed,
    By schisms rent asunder,
    By heresies distressed,
    Yet saints their watch are keeping,
    Their cry goes up, ‘How long?’
    And soon the night of weeping
    Shall be the morn of song.\n\n
    4 ’Mid toil and tribulation,
    And tumult of her war,
    She waits the consummation
    Of peace for evermore,
    Till with the vision glorious
    Her longing eyes are blest,
    And the great Church victorious
    Shall be the Church at rest.\n\n

    With God the Three in One,
    And mystic sweet communion
    With those whose rest is won.

    MAKE me a captive, Lord,

    Force me to render up my sword,
    And I shall conqueror be.
    I sink in life’s alarms
    When by myself I stand;
    Imprison me within Thine arms,
    And strong shall be my hand.\n\n
    2 My heart is weak and poor
    Until it master find;
    It has no spring of action sure–
    It varies with the wind.
    It cannot freely move,
    Till Thou hast wrought its chain:
    Enslave it with Thy matchless love,
    And deathless it shall reign.\n\n
    3 My power is faint and low
    Till I have learned to serve;
    It wants the needed fire to glow,
    It wants the breeze to nerve;
    It cannot drive the world,
    Until itself be driven;
    Its flag can only be unfurled
    When Thou shalt breathe from

    4 My will is not my own
    Till Thou hast made it Thine;
    If it would reach a monarch’s

    Amid the clashing strife,
    When on Thy bosom it has leant
    And found in Thee its life.\n\n

    And we pass away from sight,
    Father, take us through the darkness
    Into everlasting light.\n\n

    GREAT God, we sing that mighty
    hand
    By which supported still we stand;
    The opening year Thy mercy shows,
    And mercy crowns its lingering close.\n\n
    2 By day, by night, at home, abroad,
    Still are we guarded by our God,
    By His incessant bounty fed,
    By His unerring counsel led.\n\n
    3 With grateful hearts the past we own;
    The future, all to us unknown,
    We to Thy guardian care commit,
    And peaceful leave before thy
    feet.\n\n
    4 In scenes exalted or depressed
    Thou art our joy, and Thou our
    rest;
    Thy goodness all our hopes shall
    raise,
    Adored through all our changing
    days.\n\n
    5 When death shall interrupt these
    songs,
    And seal in silence mortal tongues,
    Our Helper God, in whom we
    trust.
    Shall keep our souls and guard our
    dust.\n\n

    FATHER, let me dedicate
    All my times to Thee,
    In whatever worldly state
    Thou wilt have me be;
    Not from sorrow, pain, or care
    Freedom dare I claim;
    This alone shall be my prayer,
    ‘Glorify Thy Name!’\n\n
    2 Can a child presume to choose
    Where or how to live?
    Can a father’s love refuse
    All the best to give?
    More Thou givest every day
    Than the best can claim,
    Nor withholdest aught that may
    Glorify Thy Name.\n\n
    3 If Thou callest to the cross,
    And its shadow come,
    Turning all my gain to loss,
    Shrouding heart and home,
    Let me think how Thy dear Son
    To His glory came,
    And in deepest woe pray on,
    ‘Glorify Thy Name.’\n\n
    4 If in mercy Thou wilt spare
    Joys that yet are mine,
    If on life, serene and fair,
    Brighter rays may shine,
    Let my glad heart, while it sings,
    Thee in all proclaim,
    And, whate’er the future brings,
    Glorify Thy Name.\n\n

    FOR Thy mercy and Thy grace,
    Faithful through another year,
    Hear our song of thankfulness;
    Jesus, our Redeemer, hear.\n\n
    2 Lo! Our sins on Thee we cast,
    Thee, our perfect sacrifice,
    And, forgetting all the past,
    Press towards our glorious prize.\n\n
    3 Dark the future; let Thy light
    Guide us, Bright and Morning
    Star;
    Fierce our foes, and hard the fight;
    Arm us, Saviour, for the war.\n\n
    4 In our weakness and distress,
    Rock of strength, be Thou our
    stay;
    In the pathless wilderness
    Be our true and living way.\n\n
    5 Keep us faithful, keep us pure,
    Keep us evermore Thine own;
    Help, O help us to endure;
    Fit us for the promised crown.\n\n

    AT Thy feet, our God and Father,
    Who hast blessed us all our days,
    We with grateful hearts would gather,
    To begin the year with praise,–
    Praise for light so brightly shining
    On our steps from heaven above,
    Praise for mercies daily twining
    Round us golden cords of love.\n\n
    2 Jesus, for Thy love most tender,
    On the Cross for sinners shown,
    We would praise Thee, and surren-
    der
    All our hearts to be Thine own.
    With so blest a Friend provided,
    We upon our way would go,
    Sure of being safely guided,
    Guarded well from every foe.\n\n
    3 Every day will be the brighter
    When Thy gracious face we see;
    Every burden will be lighter
    When we know it comes from
    Thee.
    Spread Thy love’s broad banner
    o’er us;
    Give us strength to serve and
    wait,
    Till the glory breaks before us,
    Through the city’s open gate.\n\n
